HW2: Procedural Texture

Fire Shader

Most of the c code is from ex1 or ex3. I also took the phong function from the examples.
Most of my work here is in fire.frag. I describe how the shader works in the comments there.

Key bindings
  m          Toggle light movement
  o          Change objects
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit

  space      Start burning
  r          Reset shader

Notes: 
If no object is visible, it is probably because it fully burnt away. Press space to start it burning again or r to reset it entirely.
For some of the objects, it takes a couple seconds for the effect to become visible.
